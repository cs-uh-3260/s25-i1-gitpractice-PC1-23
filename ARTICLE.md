<h2>Software Engineering Article paragraph</h2>
<p>I found this article on software engineering to be interesting because it gave a more personal opinion on the software engineering world. I felt like it was interesting to read about the process of getting a job in software engineering in 2021 because it is quite different now. I feel like the article does not represent the process of getting a job in SWE in 2024 accurately. In my opinion, it is much more difficult to intern at a company like Lyft, at least for an average student. <p>

Proof Reading:

Article is free of typos

_I found it interesting reading about the job-finding process in 2021 for software engineering as it is drastically different today in 2025._
